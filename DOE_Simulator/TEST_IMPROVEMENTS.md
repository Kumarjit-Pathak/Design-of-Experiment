- ✅ Metric values should be **blue**
- ✅ Metric labels should be **golden**
- ✅ Hover over buttons → should turn **golden**

**Test:** Hover over "Explore Data" button
**Expected:** Button changes from blue to golden with glow effect

---

## 📊 Step 3: Test Enhanced Sampling (Issues 1 & 2)

### Navigate to: **Sampling Methods** page (sidebar)

### Check Issue 1 (Separate Sample Sizes):
1. Look at sidebar under "Sample Size Configuration"
2. **Expected:**
   - ✅ "Treatment Sample Size" number input (default 500)
   - ✅ "Control Sample Size" number input (default 500)
   - ✅ Info box showing "Total Sample Size: 1,000"

3. **Test:** Change Treatment to 600, Control to 400
4. **Expected:** Total updates to 1,000

### Check Issue 1 (Multi-select Balance Variables):
1. Look at sidebar under "Variables to Balance"
2. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Multi-select dropdown
   - ✅ Default selections: age, gender, income_level, total_orders
   - ✅ Can add/remove multiple variables

3. **Test:** Add "location" and "avg_order_value"
4. **Expected:** Now 6 variables selected

### Check Issue 2 (Treatment Assignment):
1. Select "Simple Random Sampling"
2. Set Treatment=600, Control=400, Total=1,000
3. Click "🎲 Run Sampling"
4. **Expected:** Success message, sample created

5. Scroll down - should see new section: "🎯 Treatment Assignment"
6. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Treatment percentage slider (default 50%)
   - ✅ Metrics showing: Total Sample, Treatment, Control
   - ✅ "Assign Treatment & Control" button

7. Adjust slider to 60% (for 60-40 split)
8. **Expected:** Metrics update to show 600 treatment, 400 control

9. Click "🎯 Assign Treatment & Control"
10. **Expected:**
    - ✅ Success message "Treatment assignment complete!"
    - ✅ "📊 Allocation Summary" section appears
    - ✅ 4 metrics: Total, Treatment, Control, Ratio
    - ✅ Pie chart showing 60-40 split
    - ✅ "💾 Download & Next Steps" section appears

---

## 💾 Step 4: Test CSV Download (Issue 2)

1. Click "📥 Download Sample with Treatment Assignment"
2. **Expected:** CSV file downloads

3. Open CSV in Excel or text editor
4. **Check columns:**
   - ✅ customer_id
   - ✅ age, gender, income_level, etc. (all original features)
   - ✅ **treatment_group** (should have 0 and 1)
   - ✅ **treatment_label** (should have "Control" and "Treatment")

5. **Verify data:**
   - Treatment group = 1: ~600 rows (60%)
   - Treatment group = 0: ~400 rows (40%)
   - Treatment label matches treatment group

**Screenshot this CSV for verification!**

---

## 🔗 Step 5: Test Navigation (Issue 4)

1. After treatment assignment (from Step 3)
2. Scroll to "Download & Next Steps" section
3. Look for "🔍 Check Assignment Health" section
4. **Expected:** "📊 View Assignment Health →" button visible

5. Click "📊 View Assignment Health →"
6. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Success message appears
   - ✅ Balloons animation plays 🎈
   - ✅ Message says "Navigate to Balance Checker page using the sidebar →"

7. Use sidebar to go to "Balance Checker" page
8. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Data auto-loaded (should see treatment group distribution)
   - ✅ Balance variables from Sampling page pre-selected
   - ✅ Ready to check balance

---

## ✅ Step 6: Test Balance Checker (Issue 3)

### Navigate to: **Balance Checker** page

### Check Issue 3 (Customer ID Assignment):
1. Look at sidebar "1️⃣ Treatment Assignment"
2. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Info message: "📌 Treatment is assigned based on Customer ID for proper randomization"
   - ✅ Radio option: "Random Assignment (by Customer ID)"

3. Select "Use Pre-Assigned Column"
4. Look at dropdown
5. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Only shows: customer_id, treatment_group, treatment, group, assignment
   - ✅ Does NOT show: age, gender, income_level, location (controllable features)

**This is the critical fix!** Before, it was showing all columns which was wrong.

### Test Treatment Assignment:
1. Select "Random Assignment (by Customer ID)"
2. Set ratio to 50%
3. Click "🎲 Assign Treatment"
4. **Expected:**
   - ✅ Success message
   - ✅ Shows n treatment and n control

5. Select covariates (use defaults or the ones from Sampling)
6. Click "✅ Check Balance"

   - ✅ Balance score appears (likely 90-100%)
   - ✅ Summary table shows all covariates
   - ✅ Love plot data tab shows SMD values
   - ✅ All in **dark theme** with blue/golden colors
