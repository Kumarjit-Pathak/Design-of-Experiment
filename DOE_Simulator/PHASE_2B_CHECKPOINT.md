# Phase 2B Checkpoint - Diagnostics & Visualization

## Progress Update

### âœ… Completed (Phase 2B - Part 1)

**1. balance_checker.py** âœ“ (450 lines)
- Treatment-control balance checking
- Standardized mean differences (SMD) for numerical variables
- Chi-square tests for categorical variables
- Overall balance scoring (0-100%)
- Traffic light system (ðŸŸ¢ Excellent, ðŸŸ¡ Good, ðŸŸ  Acceptable, ðŸ”´ Poor)
- Love plot data preparation
- Balance tables (markdown/HTML/LaTeX)
- Recommendations for adjustment

**Key Features:**
- Supports 2+ groups
- Automatic threshold checking (|SMD| < 0.1 = excellent)
- Pairwise comparisons for multiple groups
- Comprehensive interpretation
- Ready for Love plot visualization

---

### ðŸ”„ Remaining (Phase 2B - Part 2)

**Still to implement (5 modules):**

1. **power_analysis.py** - Sample size determination
2. **assumption_checks.py** - Statistical assumptions (normality, homoscedasticity)
3. **balance_plots.py** - Love plots! Box plots, violin plots
4. **diagnostic_plots.py** - Q-Q plots, residual plots
5. **summary_visuals.py** - Interactive dashboards

**Estimated time:** 4-5 hours remaining

## What's Working Now

```python
from src.diagnostics.balance_checker import BalanceChecker

# Check balance between treatment and control
checker = BalanceChecker(
    data=df,
    treatment_col='treatment_group',
    group_labels={0: 'Control', 1: 'Treatment'}
)

results = checker.check_balance(
    covariates=['age', 'gender', 'income_level', 'total_orders'],
    threshold_smd=0.1
)

# Results include:
# - Overall balance score (%)
# - SMD for each covariate
# - Statistical test results
# - Love plot data (ready for plotting)
# - Recommendations
```

## Checkpoint Question

**Phase 2B has 6 total modules.** I've completed 1/6 (balance_checker - the most critical one).

**Options:**
1. **Continue and complete all 5 remaining modules** (~4-5 hours) then show you everything
2. **Pause here** for your review of balance_checker before continuing

**Which would you prefer?**

I recommend continuing since you mentioned you'll check Phase 2A later, so I can batch Phase 2B together for your review.

---

**Status:** Phase 2B is 17% complete (1 of 6 modules done)
**Next:** power_analysis.py, assumption_checks.py, then visualization modules
