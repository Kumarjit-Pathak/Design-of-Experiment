# Sample Allocation Fix - All 20,000 Units Now Assigned

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Issue:** Only 8 units allocated instead of all 20,000
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üêõ **The Problem**

**User Observation:**
> "In fractional factorial design, I am only getting 8 sample units allocated, not all 20,000. I am assuming this is going to happen for others as well."

**Root Cause:**
```python
# Old code was:
sample_units = df.sample(n=n_runs, random_state=random_seed)
# If design has 8 runs ‚Üí only samples 8 units ‚ùå
```

**The code was treating it as:**
- "Here are 8 experimental runs ‚Üí assign to 8 different customers"

**But should be:**
- "Here are 8 treatment combinations ‚Üí assign ALL 20,000 customers across these 8 combinations"

---

## ‚úÖ **The Fix**

**New Logic:**
1. Extract unique treatment combinations from design (e.g., 8 unique combos)
2. Allocate ALL 20,000 customers across these combinations
3. Equal allocation: ~2,500 customers per combination

**New Code:**
```python
# Get unique treatment combinations
unique_combos = design[factor_cols].drop_duplicates()
n_combos = len(unique_combos)  # e.g., 8

# Allocate ALL units
n_total = len(df)  # 20,000
base_size = n_total // n_combos  # 20,000 / 8 = 2,500

# Create assignment vector
assignments = []
for i in range(n_combos):
    n_in_combo = base_size + (1 if i < remainder else 0)
    assignments.extend([i] * n_in_combo)  # 2,500 of combo 0, 2,500 of combo 1, etc.

# Randomize
np.random.shuffle(assignments)

# Assign to all customers
df_assigned = df.copy()
for factor in factor_cols:
    df_assigned[factor] = unique_combos.iloc[assignments][factor].values
```

## üìä **Example: Fractional Factorial 2^(5-2)**

**Design:**
- 5 factors, 8 runs, Resolution III
- 8 unique treatment combinations

**Before Fix:**
```
‚úÖ Design assigned to 8 sample units!
```
‚ùå Only 8 customers assigned (0.04% of dataset)

**After Fix:**
```
‚úÖ All 20,000 units assigned across 8 treatment combinations!

Total Units Assigned: 20,000
Treatment Combinations: 8
Avg. per Combination: 2,500

Allocation Summary:
Treatment Combination              | Count
A=-1 | B=-1 | C=-1 | D=-1 | E=1   | 2,500
A=-1 | B=-1 | C=1  | D=1  | E=-1  | 2,500
A=1  | B=-1 | C=-1 | D=-1 | E=-1  | 2,500
... (8 combinations total)
```
‚úÖ All 20,000 customers assigned (100% of dataset)

## üîß **Applied To All 3 Design Types**

### **1. Fractional Factorial Design**
- Gets unique combinations from design
- Allocates all 20,000 units equally across combinations

### **2. Central Composite Design (CCD)**
- 3 factors, rotatable ‚Üí 19 unique points (8 factorial + 6 axial + 5 center)
- But center points are duplicates ‚Üí ~13 unique combinations
- All 20,000 units allocated

### **3. Box-Behnken Design**
- 3 factors ‚Üí 15 unique points (12 edge + 3 center)
- But center points duplicate ‚Üí ~13 unique combinations
- All 20,000 units allocated
