# 🚀 START HERE - DOE Simulator Quick Launch

## Your DOE Simulator is READY! 🎉

Everything is built and tested. Just follow these 3 simple steps:

---

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (30 seconds)

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\40103061\Anheuser-Busch InBev\Kumarjit Backup - General\Articles\Design of Experiment\DOE_Simulator"

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** Most packages are already installed! ✅ This will just ensure everything is up-to-date.

---

## Step 2: Launch the App (5 seconds)

```bash
cd app

streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**Expected:** Your browser will automatically open to http://localhost:8501

---

## Step 3: Explore! 🎊

You'll see 4 pages in the sidebar:

### 🏠 Home
- Overview of features
- Quick navigation

### 📊 Data Explorer
- Explore 20,000 customers
- **Try the filters!** (Income, Location, Gender)
- View distributions, correlations, missing data

### 🎲 Sampling Methods
- **Try Stratified Sampling!**
  - Select "Stratified Sampling"
  - Choose "income_level" for stratification
  - Click "Run Sampling"
  - **See the 6.56% efficiency gain!**

### ✅ Balance Checker
- Click "Assign Treatment" (creates 50-50 split)
- Select covariates (age, gender, income_level, total_orders)
- Click "Check Balance"
- **See balance score and Love plot data!**

---

## 🎯 Quick Demo Workflow (5 minutes)

1. **Launch app** (Step 2 above)

2. **Data Explorer:**
   - Go to "Correlations" tab
   - See orders ↔ lifetime value correlation (r=0.80)

3. **Sampling Methods:**
   - Select "Stratified Sampling"
   - Stratify by: "income_level"
   - Allocation: "proportional"
   - Sample size: 1000
   - Click "Run Sampling"
   - **Result:** See stratum balance and efficiency gain!

4. **Balance Checker:**
   - Click "Assign Treatment" button
   - Keep default covariates selected
   - Click "Check Balance"
   - **Result:** See balance score (should be 90%+)
   - Check "Love Plot Data" tab for SMD values

5. **Download:**
   - Download sample as CSV
   - Use for further analysis
