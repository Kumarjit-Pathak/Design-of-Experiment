1.  now create a good sample data to showcase practical of all types of sample design and
  dygonestic checks . Take an example from online shopping . generate 20000 lines of data so that we have enough sample for allocation with diverse characteristics 

  2. then generate each part of the code(from simple   
  random sampling to all advance methods mentioned on the article) as seperate .py , user should just provide  
  path to the data and column details(dataset path, methodology, target column, what are the columns to        
  balance etc) on a json , based on this input required component should run 

  3. create an option at on the webpage or streamlit or any other tool which can be hosted on github. I want a simulator to showcase a demo of each technique based on the simulated data , user can select requird details on the simulator and select technique, this should give them the health of allocation with fantastic visuals between treatment and control and statistical tests result and conclusion 

  4. have the right folder structure with good coding style and commnets
